# VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid 2.x Air-Gapped Reference Design and Deployment

You can deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management clusters and Tanzu Kubernetes Grid workload clusters in air-gapped environments that do not have a physical connection to the Internet.

This documentation provides reference designs for deploying VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (informally known as TKG) in an air-gapped environment. This information is valid for TKG from version 2.3 onwards.

The VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Air-Gapped Reference Design document provides steps to deploy the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid management and workload clusters in a specific and validated configuration in air-gapped environments. For the generic steps to deploy the management and workload clusters on air-gapped environments, see [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Documentation](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/standalone-components/tanzu-kubernetes-grid/2-5/tkg/mgmt-reqs-prep-offline.html).
